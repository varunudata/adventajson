    "solution": "### Analysis of Assertion (A)\nThe fringe width (distance between consecutive bright or dark fringes) in a Young's double-slit experiment (YDSE) is given by the formula $\\beta = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}$. Here, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\nWhen the entire apparatus is immersed in an optically denser medium with a refractive index $\\mu > 1$, the wavelength of light in that medium changes to $\\lambda_{medium} = \\frac{\\lambda_{air}}{\\mu}$.\nSince $\\mu > 1$, the wavelength in the medium is less than in air ($\\lambda_{medium} < \\lambda_{air}$).\nThe new fringe width will be $\\beta_{medium} = \\frac{\\lambda_{medium} D}{d} = \\frac{\\lambda_{air} D}{\\mu d} = \\frac{\\beta_{air}}{\\mu}$.\nAs $\\mu > 1$, the fringe width decreases ($\\beta_{medium} < \\beta_{air}$), meaning the fringes come closer together. Thus, **Assertion (A) is true**.\n\n### Analysis of Reason (R)\nWhen light travels from a rarer medium (like air) to an optically denser medium, its speed decreases. The refractive index ($\\mu$) is defined by the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to its speed in the medium (v), i.e., $\\mu = c/v$. The frequency of a light wave is determined by its source and does not change when the medium changes. Since the wave speed is related to frequency (f) and wavelength ($\\lambda$) by $v = f\\lambda$, if v decreases and f remains constant, the wavelength $\\lambda$ must also decrease. Thus, **Reason (R) is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Reason (R) provides the correct physical explanation for why the wavelength of light decreases in a denser medium. This decrease in wavelength is the direct cause of the decrease in fringe width mentioned in the Assertion (A). Therefore, **both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)**.",

This acidic hydrogen reacts with active metals like sodium.\nThe reaction is: $2CH_3-C \\equiv CH(g) + 2Na(s) \\rightarrow 2CH_3-C \\equiv C^-Na^+(s) + H_2(g)$.\nAccording to the stoichiometry of this reaction, 2 moles of propyne produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas. Therefore, 1 mole of propyne will produce $1/2$ mole of $H_2$ gas. **Statement I is correct.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement II\nPropyne reacts with sodamide ($NaNH_2$) in an acid-base reaction to produce ammonia gas:\n$CH_3-C \\equiv CH + NaNH_2 \\rightarrow CH_3-C \\equiv C^-Na^+ + NH_3$.\nFirst, calculate the moles of 4 g of propyne ($C_3H_4$).\nThe molar mass of propyne is approximately $3(12) + 4(1) = 40$ g/mol.\nMoles of propyne = $\\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{molar mass}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ g}}{40 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.1$ mol.\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry, 1 mole of propyne produces 1 mole of $NH_3$.

Let Ni's state be x. Then $x + 4(-1) = -2$, which gives $x = +2$. The oxidation state is **Ni(II)**.\n2.  **Electron Configuration of Ni(II)**: Neutral Ni (Z=28) is $[Ar] 3d^8 4s^2$. $Ni^{2+}$ is $[Ar] 3d^8$.\n3.  **Hybridization and Geometry**: $Cl^-$ is a weak-field ligand, so it will not cause the pairing of the 3d electrons. For bonding with four ligands, Ni uses its empty outer orbitals, one 4s and three 4p, to form four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals.\n4.  **Geometry**: $sp^3$ hybridization corresponds to a **tetrahedral** geometry.\n5.  **Magnetic Behaviour**: The $3d^8$ configuration has two unpaired electrons (${\\uparrow\\downarrow} {\\uparrow\\downarrow} {\\uparrow\\downarrow} {\\uparrow} {\\uparrow}$). This makes the complex **paramagnetic**, which matches the given information.\n\n### $[Ni(CO)_{4}]$\n1.  **Oxidation State of Ni**: Carbonyl (CO) is a neutral ligand. Thus, the oxidation state of Ni is **Ni(0)**.\n2.  **Electron Configuration of Ni(0)**: Neutral Ni is $[Ar] 3d^8 4s^2$.\n3.  **Hybridization and Geometry**: CO is a strong-field ligand. It causes the pairing of electrons. The two electrons from the 4s orbital are pushed into the 3d orbital, resulting in a filled $3d^{10}$ configuration. Ni then uses its empty 4s and 4p orbitals for bonding, leading to $sp^3$ hybridization.\n4.  **Geometry**: $sp^3$ hybridization corresponds to a **tetrahedral** geometry.\n5.  **Magnetic Behaviour**: The final configuration is $3d^{10}$, meaning there are no unpaired electrons.

The second carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical hydrogen atoms. A necessary condition for geometrical isomerism is that each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two different groups. Since this condition is not met, propene cannot exhibit geometrical isomerism. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n* **(B) Trans isomer has identical atoms/groups on the opposite sides of the double bond.**\n    This is the correct definition of a trans isomer. **This statement is correct.**\n\n* **(C) Cis-but-2-ene has higher dipole moment than trans-but-2-ene.**\n    In cis-but-2-ene, the C-CH₃ bond dipoles are on the same side, leading to a net molecular dipole moment. In trans-but-2-ene, the molecule is symmetrical, and the bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a zero dipole moment. Thus, the cis isomer has a higher dipole moment. **This statement is correct.**\n\n* **(D) 2-methylbut-2-ene shows two geometrical isomers.**\n    The structure is $(CH_3)_2C=CH-CH_3$. The first carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical methyl groups. This violates the condition for geometrical isomerism. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n* **(E) Trans-isomer has lower melting point that cis isomer.**\n    Generally, trans isomers are more symmetrical than their cis counterparts.

The $S_N2$ mechanism proceeds via a backside attack of the nucleophile on the carbon bearing the leaving group. In neopentyl chloride, this carbon is bonded to a very large and bulky tert-butyl group.

For the $Ni^{2+}$ ion, the configuration is $[Ar] 3d^8$.\n3.  **Hybridization & Geometry:** $Cl^-$ is a weak-field ligand and cannot force the pairing of the 3d electrons. For bonding with four ligands, the central atom uses its empty outer orbitals: one 4s and three 4p orbitals. This leads to **$sp^3$ hybridization** and a **tetrahedral** geometry.\n4.  **Magnetic Behaviour:** The $3d^8$ configuration leaves two unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. The presence of unpaired electrons makes the complex **paramagnetic**, which matches the given information.\n\n### Analysis of $[Ni(CO)_{4}]$:\n1.  **Oxidation State:** The carbonyl ligand (CO) is neutral. Therefore, the oxidation state of Ni is **Ni(0)**.\n2.  **Electron Configuration:** Neutral Ni is $[Ar] 3d^8 4s^2$.\n3.  **Hybridization & Geometry:** CO is a very strong-field ligand.

    "solution": "The problem asks for the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of a first-order reaction, which is the time required for 50% of the reactant to be converted.\n\n**1. Calculate the Rate Constant (k) using the Arrhenius Equation:**\nThe Arrhenius equation is $k = A e^{-E_a/RT}$.\n-   Given parameters:\n    -   Frequency factor, $A = 10^{20} s^{-1}$\n    -   Activation energy, $E_a = 191.48 \\text{ kJ/mol} = 191480 \\text{ J/mol}$\n    -   Gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J K}^{-1} \\text{mol}^{-1}$\n    -   Temperature, $T = 1000$ K\n\n-   First, calculate the exponent term $\\frac{E_a}{RT}$:\n    $\\frac{E_a}{RT} = \\frac{191480 \\text{ J/mol}}{8.314 \\text{ J K}^{-1} \\text{mol}^{-1} \\times 1000 \\text{ K}} \\approx 23.03$\n    (Note that $23.03 \\approx 10 \\times \\ln(10) = \\ln(10^{10})$).\n\n-   Now, substitute this into the Arrhenius equation:\n    $k = 10^{20} \\times e^{-23.03}$\n    $k \\approx 10^{20} \\times e^{-\\ln(10^{10})} = 10^{20} \\times \\frac{1}{10^{10}} = 10^{10} s^{-1}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$):**\nFor a first-order reaction, the half-life is given by $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{k}$.\n-   Using $\\ln 2 \\approx 0.693$:\n    $t_{1/2} = \\frac{0.693}{10^{10} s^{-1}} = 0.693 \\times 10^{-10}$ s.\n\n**3. Convert to Picoseconds (ps):**\nSince $1 \\text{ ps} = 10^{-12} \\text{ s}$, we convert the time:\n$t_{1/2} = 0.693 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ s} = 69.3 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ s} = 69.3$ ps.\n\n**4. Final Answer:**\nThe question asks for the answer as the nearest integer, so we round 69.3 to **69**.",
