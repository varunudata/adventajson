    "solution": "### Analysis of Assertion (A)\nThe fringe width (distance between consecutive bright or dark fringes) in a Young's double-slit experiment (YDSE) is given by the formula $\\beta = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}$. Here, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\nWhen the entire apparatus is immersed in an optically denser medium with a refractive index $\\mu > 1$, the wavelength of light in that medium changes to $\\lambda_{medium} = \\frac{\\lambda_{air}}{\\mu}$.\nSince $\\mu > 1$, the wavelength in the medium is less than in air ($\\lambda_{medium} < \\lambda_{air}$).\nThe new fringe width will be $\\beta_{medium} = \\frac{\\lambda_{medium} D}{d} = \\frac{\\lambda_{air} D}{\\mu d} = \\frac{\\beta_{air}}{\\mu}$.\nAs $\\mu > 1$, the fringe width decreases ($\\beta_{medium} < \\beta_{air}$), meaning the fringes come closer together. Thus, **Assertion (A) is true**.\n\n### Analysis of Reason (R)\nWhen light travels from a rarer medium (like air) to an optically denser medium, its speed decreases. The refractive index ($\\mu$) is defined by the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to its speed in the medium (v), i.e., $\\mu = c/v$. The frequency of a light wave is determined by its source and does not change when the medium changes. Since the wave speed is related to frequency (f) and wavelength ($\\lambda$) by $v = f\\lambda$, if v decreases and f remains constant, the wavelength $\\lambda$ must also decrease. Thus, **Reason (R) is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Reason (R) provides the correct physical explanation for why the wavelength of light decreases in a denser medium. This decrease in wavelength is the direct cause of the decrease in fringe width mentioned in the Assertion (A). Therefore, **both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)**.",

This acidic hydrogen reacts with active metals like sodium.\nThe reaction is: $2CH_3-C \\equiv CH(g) + 2Na(s) \\rightarrow 2CH_3-C \\equiv C^-Na^+(s) + H_2(g)$.\nAccording to the stoichiometry of this reaction, 2 moles of propyne produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas. Therefore, 1 mole of propyne will produce $1/2$ mole of $H_2$ gas. **Statement I is correct.**\n\n### Analysis of Statement II\nPropyne reacts with sodamide ($NaNH_2$) in an acid-base reaction to produce ammonia gas:\n$CH_3-C \\equiv CH + NaNH_2 \\rightarrow CH_3-C \\equiv C^-Na^+ + NH_3$.\nFirst, calculate the moles of 4 g of propyne ($C_3H_4$).\nThe molar mass of propyne is approximately $3(12) + 4(1) = 40$ g/mol.\nMoles of propyne = $\\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{molar mass}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ g}}{40 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.1$ mol.\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry, 1 mole of propyne produces 1 mole of $NH_3$.

Let Ni's state be x. Then $x + 4(-1) = -2$, which gives $x = +2$. The oxidation state is **Ni(II)**.\n2.  **Electron Configuration of Ni(II)**: Neutral Ni (Z=28) is $[Ar] 3d^8 4s^2$. $Ni^{2+}$ is $[Ar] 3d^8$.\n3.  **Hybridization and Geometry**: $Cl^-$ is a weak-field ligand, so it will not cause the pairing of the 3d electrons. For bonding with four ligands, Ni uses its empty outer orbitals, one 4s and three 4p, to form four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals.\n4.  **Geometry**: $sp^3$ hybridization corresponds to a **tetrahedral** geometry.\n5.  **Magnetic Behaviour**: The $3d^8$ configuration has two unpaired electrons (${\\uparrow\\downarrow} {\\uparrow\\downarrow} {\\uparrow\\downarrow} {\\uparrow} {\\uparrow}$). This makes the complex **paramagnetic**, which matches the given information.\n\n### $[Ni(CO)_{4}]$\n1.  **Oxidation State of Ni**: Carbonyl (CO) is a neutral ligand. Thus, the oxidation state of Ni is **Ni(0)**.\n2.  **Electron Configuration of Ni(0)**: Neutral Ni is $[Ar] 3d^8 4s^2$.\n3.  **Hybridization and Geometry**: CO is a strong-field ligand. It causes the pairing of electrons. The two electrons from the 4s orbital are pushed into the 3d orbital, resulting in a filled $3d^{10}$ configuration. Ni then uses its empty 4s and 4p orbitals for bonding, leading to $sp^3$ hybridization.\n4.  **Geometry**: $sp^3$ hybridization corresponds to a **tetrahedral** geometry.\n5.  **Magnetic Behaviour**: The final configuration is $3d^{10}$, meaning there are no unpaired electrons.

The second carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical hydrogen atoms. A necessary condition for geometrical isomerism is that each carbon of the double bond must be attached to two different groups. Since this condition is not met, propene cannot exhibit geometrical isomerism. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n* **(B) Trans isomer has identical atoms/groups on the opposite sides of the double bond.**\n    This is the correct definition of a trans isomer. **This statement is correct.**\n\n* **(C) Cis-but-2-ene has higher dipole moment than trans-but-2-ene.**\n    In cis-but-2-ene, the C-CH₃ bond dipoles are on the same side, leading to a net molecular dipole moment. In trans-but-2-ene, the molecule is symmetrical, and the bond dipoles cancel each other out, resulting in a zero dipole moment. Thus, the cis isomer has a higher dipole moment. **This statement is correct.**\n\n* **(D) 2-methylbut-2-ene shows two geometrical isomers.**\n    The structure is $(CH_3)_2C=CH-CH_3$. The first carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical methyl groups. This violates the condition for geometrical isomerism. **This statement is incorrect.**\n\n* **(E) Trans-isomer has lower melting point that cis isomer.**\n    Generally, trans isomers are more symmetrical than their cis counterparts.

The $S_N2$ mechanism proceeds via a backside attack of the nucleophile on the carbon bearing the leaving group. In neopentyl chloride, this carbon is bonded to a very large and bulky tert-butyl group.

For the $Ni^{2+}$ ion, the configuration is $[Ar] 3d^8$.\n3.  **Hybridization & Geometry:** $Cl^-$ is a weak-field ligand and cannot force the pairing of the 3d electrons. For bonding with four ligands, the central atom uses its empty outer orbitals: one 4s and three 4p orbitals. This leads to **$sp^3$ hybridization** and a **tetrahedral** geometry.\n4.  **Magnetic Behaviour:** The $3d^8$ configuration leaves two unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. The presence of unpaired electrons makes the complex **paramagnetic**, which matches the given information.\n\n### Analysis of $[Ni(CO)_{4}]$:\n1.  **Oxidation State:** The carbonyl ligand (CO) is neutral.

These two blocks can be arranged in a queue in $2! = 2$ ways (GB or BG).\n\n2.  **Arrangement within the Girls' block**: The 3 girls can be arranged among themselves within their block in $3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ ways.\n\n3.  **Arrangement within the Boys' block (with restriction)**: The 4 boys ($B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4$) must be arranged such that $B_1$ and $B_2$ are not adjacent.\n    * First, calculate the total possible arrangements of the 4 boys without any restrictions: $4! = 24$ ways.\n    * Next, calculate the number of arrangements where $B_1$ and $B_2$ *are* adjacent.

In this case, the skeleton is that of 2-methylbutane (an isopentyl skeleton).\n4.  **Find All Possible Starting Materials (R-Br)**: We need to find the number of distinct structural isomers that can be formed by attaching a bromine atom to the 2-methylbutane skeleton.

Let's rearrange differently.\n    $(1+y^2) + (x-2e^{\\tan^{-1}y})\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n    Divide by $dx$: $(1+y^2)\\frac{dx}{dy} + x - 2e^{\\tan^{-1}y} = 0$\n    Divide by $(1+y^2)$: $\\frac{dx}{dy} + \\frac{x}{1+y^2} = \\frac{2e^{\\tan^{-1}y}}{1+y^2}$.\n\n2.  **Find the Integrating Factor (I.F.)**: The equation is now in the linear form $\\frac{dx}{dy} + P(y)x = Q(y)$.\n    Here, $P(y) = \\frac{1}{1+y^2}$.\n    The integrating factor is $I.F. = e^{\\int P(y)dy} = e^{\\int \\frac{1}{1+y^2}dy} = e^{\\tan^{-1}y}$.\n\n3.  **Solve the Equation**: The general solution is $x \\cdot (I.F.) = \\int Q(y) \\cdot (I.F.) dy + C$.\n    $x \\cdot e^{\\tan^{-1}y} = \\int \\left( \\frac{2e^{\\tan^{-1}y}}{1+y^2} \\right) \\cdot e^{\\tan^{-1}y} dy + C$\n    $x \\cdot e^{\\tan^{-1}y} = \\int \\frac{2(e^{\\tan^{-1}y})^2}{1+y^2} dy + C$.\n    To solve the integral, let $u = \\tan^{-1}y$, so $du = \\frac{1}{1+y^2}dy$.

Its power is given by the Lens Maker's formula: $P = \\frac{1}{f} = (\\mu - 1) (\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2})$. For a symmetric biconvex lens with radius of curvature R for both surfaces, $R_1 = R$ and $R_2 = -R$. So, the original power is $P_{original} = (\\mu - 1) (\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{-R}) = (\\mu - 1) \\frac{2}{R}$. [cite_start]We are given $P_{original} = 4$ D. [cite: 453]\n\n2.  **Effect of the Cuts**: The lens is cut into four identical pieces by a vertical plane (CD) and a horizontal plane (AB).\n    * The **horizontal cut** (along the principal axis) reduces the aperture of the lens but does not change its focal length or power.\n    * The **vertical cut** (perpendicular to the principal axis) changes the geometry of the lens. It turns a biconvex lens into two plano-convex lenses.\n\n### Calculating the New Power\n\nAfter both cuts, each of the four pieces is a small plano-convex lens. [cite_start]Let's find the power of one such piece.\n\n* For a resulting plano-convex piece, one surface is planar ($R_1 = \\infty$) and the other is curved ($R_2 = -R$).\n* Using the Lens Maker's formula for this part:\n    $P_{part} = (\\mu - 1) (\\frac{1}{\\infty} - \\frac{1}{-R}) = (\\mu - 1) \\frac{1}{R}$.\n\n### Relating the Powers\n\nNow, we compare the power of the part to the original power:\n* $P_{original} = (\\mu - 1) \\frac{2}{R}$\n* $P_{part} = (\\mu - 1) \\frac{1}{R}$\n\nBy comparing these two expressions, we can see that $P_{part} = \\frac{1}{2} P_{original}$.\nGiven $P_{original} = 4$ D, the power of one part is:\n$P_{part} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\text{ D} = 2 \\text{ D}$.

It has a strong electron-donating resonance effect (+M) and a weaker electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). The +M effect dominates and strongly stabilizes the positive charge through delocalization of the oxygen's lone pairs. This is a very powerful stabilizing effect.\n\n2.  **Carbocation B (benzyl)**: This is the parent carbocation, stabilized only by the resonance of the benzene ring itself.\n\n3.  **Carbocation C (p-methylbenzyl)**: The methyl group (-CH₃) is at the para position. It is an electron-donating group that stabilizes the carbocation through hyperconjugation (+H effect) and a weak inductive effect (+I effect). Hyperconjugation is less effective at stabilization than the +M effect.\n\n4.  **Carbocation D (m-methoxybenzyl)**: The methoxy group is at the meta position. From the meta position, the resonance (+M) effect cannot delocalize charge to the benzylic carbon. Only the electron-withdrawing inductive (-I) effect operates, which *destabilizes* the carbocation relative to the unsubstituted benzyl carbocation.\n\n**Stability Order**:\nBased on the electronic effects, the order of stability is:\n(Strongest stabilization by +M) > (Stabilization by +H) > (Resonance only) > (Destabilization by -I)\n\nTherefore, **(A) p-methoxybenzyl > (C) p-methylbenzyl > (B) benzyl > (D) m-methoxybenzyl**.\n\nThe most stable carbocation is A.",

The time period (T) of a simple pendulum is given by the formula $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$, where L is the length and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n2.  Let's compare the acceleration due to gravity on Earth ($g_E$) and the new planet ($g_P$). The formula for g on a celestial body is $g = \\frac{GM}{R^2}$.\n3.  For Earth: $g_E = \\frac{GM_E}{R_E^2}$.\n4.  For the planet: Mass $M_P = 4M_E$ and Radius $R_P = 2R_E$.\n    $g_P = \\frac{G M_P}{R_P^2} = \\frac{G(4M_E)}{(2R_E)^2} = \\frac{4GM_E}{4R_E^2} = \\frac{GM_E}{R_E^2} = g_E$.\n5.  Since $g_P = g_E$ and the length L of the pendulum is constant, the time period T will be the same on both the Earth and the planet. Thus, **Assertion (A) is True**.\n\n### Analysis of Reason (R)\n\n1.  The reason states that the mass of the pendulum remains unchanged. Mass is an intrinsic property of matter and is constant regardless of location. Thus, **Reason (R) is True**.\n\n### Relationship between Assertion and Reason\n\n1.  The Assertion is true because the value of 'g' is the same on both bodies.\n2.  The Reason, while a true statement, is not the correct explanation for the Assertion. The time period of a simple pendulum is independent of its mass. The constancy of the pendulum's mass does not explain why the time period is constant in this scenario.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true statements, but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation for Assertion (A).",

The non-metallic elements are Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P).\n    * **Weakest E-E Bond**: We need to compare the single bond strength of N-N and P-P. Due to the small size of the nitrogen atom, there is significant repulsion between the lone pairs of electrons on adjacent nitrogen atoms in a N-N single bond. This lone pair-lone pair repulsion makes the N-N single bond exceptionally weak (bond energy ~160 kJ/mol), much weaker than the P-P single bond (~200 kJ/mol). Therefore, the element 'E' is **Nitrogen**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Maximum Covalency of Nitrogen**:\n    * **Covalency** is the number of covalent bonds an atom can form.\n    * Nitrogen's electron configuration is $[He] 2s^2 2p^3$.

    "solution": "This question tests the knowledge of specific reagents used for converting various nitrogen-containing functional groups into amines.\n\n* **(A) Amide ($R-CO-NH_2$)**: Amides can be reduced to primary amines using a strong reducing agent like **Lithium Aluminium Hydride ($LiAlH_4$)**, followed by hydrolysis. This reaction reduces the carbonyl group to a methylene group. Thus, **(A) matches with (III)**.\n\n* **(B) Nitro Group ($-NO_2$)**: The reduction of an aromatic nitro group to a primary amine is a standard reaction, commonly achieved using a metal in an acidic medium. **Tin and hydrochloric acid (Sn/HCl)** is a classic reagent for this conversion. Thus, **(B) matches with (IV)**.\n\n* **(C) Nitrile ($R-C\\equiv N$)**: Nitriles can be reduced to primary amines by several methods, including catalytic hydrogenation. Using **hydrogen gas with a Nickel catalyst ($H_2/Ni$)** is a common method for this reduction. Thus, **(C) matches with (II)**.\n\n* **(D) N-Alkylphthalimide**: This compound is the intermediate in the Gabriel phthalimide synthesis of primary amines. The final step to liberate the primary amine ($R-NH_2$) from this intermediate is typically achieved by hydrolysis with a base, such as **aqueous Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)**. Thus, **(D) matches with (I)**.\n\nThe correct matching is (A)-(III), (B)-(IV), (C)-(II), (D)-(I).",

    "solution": "Let's analyze the provided reaction energy profile diagram.\n\n### Activation Energy\n* **Forward Reaction**: The activation energy ($E_{a,fwd}$) is the energy required to go from the reactants to the activated complex (the peak). From the diagram, this corresponds to the sum of the energy intervals $E_2$ (from reactant to product level) and $E_1$ (from product level to the peak).\n    $E_{a,fwd} = E_1 + E_2$.\n* **Backward Reaction**: The activation energy ($E_{a,bwd}$) is the energy required to go from the products back to the activated complex. From the diagram, this is represented by the energy interval $E_1$.\n\n### Stability and Enthalpy\n* **Relative Stability**: The diagram shows that the final energy level of the products is higher than the initial energy level of the reactants. In chemistry, lower potential energy corresponds to greater stability. Therefore, the **product is less stable than the reactant**.\n* **Enthalpy Change ($\Delta H$)**: The change in enthalpy for the reaction is the difference between the energy of the products and the energy of the reactants. Here, $\Delta H = E_{products} - E_{reactants} = E_2$, which is a positive value. This indicates an **endothermic reaction**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n* **(A)**: States backward activation energy is $E_1$ (correct) but product is more stable (incorrect).\n* **(B)**: States forward activation energy is $E_1+E_2$ (correct) but product is more stable (incorrect).\n* **(C)**: States forward activation energy is $E_1+E_2$ (correct) and product is less stable than reactant (correct).\n* **(D)**: States activation energy for both is $E_1+E_2$ (incorrect).\n\nThe only statement that is entirely correct is (C).",

Orbitals are considered **degenerate** if they possess the same amount of energy. Within a given subshell (like the 2p subshell), all orbitals ($2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z$) are degenerate in the absence of external electric or magnetic fields. Therefore, Statement (II) is **True**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement (I)**: This statement claims a spectral line will be observed for a $2p_{x} \\rightarrow 2p_{y}$ transition. Atomic spectral lines are produced when an electron moves between two distinct energy levels, causing the absorption or emission of a photon whose energy equals the difference between the levels ($\\Delta E$). Since $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ are degenerate, the energy difference between them is zero ($\\Delta E = 0$). A transition between two states with no energy difference does not involve the emission or absorption of a photon. Consequently, no spectral line can be observed. Therefore, Statement (I) is **False**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Statement (I) is false and Statement (II) is true.",

Corrosion is an electrochemical process where oxidation and reduction occur at different sites. The site that is more easily oxidized acts as the anode, and this is typically a region of higher stress, impurity, or a more reactive metal. The less reactive site acts as the cathode. [cite_start]The convention, as supported by the provided solution text[cite: 1153], is that the pure metal site acts as the anode (where oxidation, i.e., corrosion, occurs) and the impure site acts as the cathode. Thus, **Statement (I) is True**. \n\n2.  **Analyze Statement (II)**: This statement compares the rate of corrosion in alkaline versus acidic media. The corrosion of metals like iron typically involves the reduction of oxygen. This reduction process is significantly catalyzed by the presence of H⁺ ions, which are abundant in acidic solutions ($O_2(g) + 4H^+(aq) + 4e^- \\rightarrow 2H_2O(l)$). In alkaline or neutral solutions, the process is slower. Therefore, the rate of corrosion is generally much higher in acidic medium than in alkaline medium. Thus, **Statement (II) is False**. \n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Since Statement (I) is true and Statement (II) is false, the correct option is D.",
